# Spotify MPRIS Bridge

The idea of this extension is to provide a bridge between the [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/) interface and the Spotify Web Player.

This project takes much inspiration (and code) from [Spotify Web Player Hotkeys Firefox Extension](https://github.com/TsunDoge/spotify-hotkeys-firefox/)
